curie_map  could be
OMIA": "http://omia.org/OMIA" instead of 'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMIA_'

We get a gene in a species linked with an observable
standard monarch g2p type association.


# association's predicate  --
# we may need a more specific term which does not exst yet
# the closest I come up with is:

    "is genetic basis for condition": "RO:0004010"

Made a monarch association model in graphviz dot format using these file headers and
the global translation table labels.
Is may be found in the file

    "dipper/resources/omia/casual_mutation.gv"

casual_mutation.gv could serve as
a guide to parsing the file and
interperting/checking the results.   _IF_ we decide to ingest it
